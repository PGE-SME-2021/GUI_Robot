## Group Organisation
At We are going to divide our job in stages.
- First Stage: consist to learn and explore al capabilities of our tools. We will work with simulate data in this stage (no interaction).
- Second Stage: we are going to share information between groups to solve integration bugs. Still inside GUI
- Third Stage: we are going to Work with actual hardware and sensors to integrate our systems.

Those stages are susceptible to change because we dont know exactly the problems that are going to appear in the way.
## Organisation
For organisation we will use Issues to track the backlog and activities we will do. It is not fully mandatory but it will help a lot if we want to keep everything organized.
